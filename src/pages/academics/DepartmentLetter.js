                        <p>Our Department was established in 2007 offering four year undergraduate programme, (B.Tech) in
                            Information Technology. Over the years, we have grown our expertise and competence in the core
                            Information Technology curriculum and research holding the Institute's tradition of excellence
                            as a world-class leader in IT education and research. </p>

                        <p>Technology changes rapidly, especially in the field of computing, whereas the science, if it
                            changes at all, does so much more gradually. Our understanding is that persons who are clear and
                            thorough about the fundamentals can adapt to rapid changes in technology relatively easily. We
                            want the education imparted to our students to be the basis of a life time of learning. Our
                            constant pursuit is to help our students achive expertise and competence in the core Information
                            Technology curriculum and research.</p>

                        <p> One bright spot is that, notwithstanding the pandemic, we have been able to continue to expand
                            and recruit more faculty members of outstanding quality and likewise with students. We were also
                            granted a respectable sum of money for equipment from the Institute under the IoE scheme.</p>
                        <p>Our Department has produced hundreds of professionals and has established a name for itself in
                            different fields. Our students have consistently excelled in the highly competitive industrial
                            environments. I attribute this success to the winning combination of a dedicated faculty that
                            works hard at imparting quality education, a well-planned syllabus and last but not least, our
                            students.</p>
                        <p>
                            We are thankful to our alumni for their continued support which has been a key enabling factor
                            in our growth and achievements. Please stay in touch and write to us with any new ideas for the
                            department to excel further in its mission. </p><br />
